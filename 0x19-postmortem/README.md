A Fictional Post Mortem Report
Issue Summary
On a not-so-fine morning of April 12, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (GMT), our web application decided to take an unplanned vacation. Impact? Oh, it was like a rock concert without the rock - the service was completely down. Around 45% of our users were left holding tickets to a show that wasn’t happening.
Timeline
10:00 AM: Our monitoring system started screaming. Something was up!
10:15 AM: Our engineers, armed with coffee and determination, began their quest, suspecting a server issue.
10:45 AM: The servers were innocent! The hunt continued.
11:30 AM: The network team was called in. It was time for the big guns.
1:00 PM: Eureka! The network team found the culprit - a mischievous misconfiguration in our load balancer.
2:00 PM: Peace was restored. The misconfiguration was corrected, and the load balancer was back on track.
Root Cause and Resolution
Our load balancer, usually a reliable chap, had a bad day due to a misconfiguration. This led to a traffic jam worse than a Monday morning rush hour, making our servers unreachable. The issue was fixed by giving the load balancer a little TLC (Tender Loving Configuration).
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To avoid such adventures in the future, we’re going to:
Give our configuration management practices a makeover.
Install a new burglar alarm - monitoring alerts for load balancer configurations.
Conduct regular ‘health check-ups’ of our network configurations.
Organize a ‘Best Practices for Configuration Management’ workshop for our team.
We’ve learned a lot from this incident, and we’re committed to making sure it doesn’t happen again. We apologize to our users for the inconvenience and thank them for their patience. After all, without them, we’d just be a rock band without an audience.
